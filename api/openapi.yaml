    \n\r\n---\r\n## App Submission Process\r\n### Your App-Building Journey\r\n\r\n\
    Ready to get started? Build your app by navigating through the following stages:\r\
    \n\r\n#### Onboard\r\n\r\nStart off by learning about the various parts of the\
    \ Rise ecosystem. This will help you understand where and how you can add your\
    \ own functionality to a Rise merchant.\r\n\r\nYou can jump right in and quickly\
    \ build a simple app, or try out one of our many tutorials and app templates,\
    \ covering a wide range of business cases.\r\n\r\n> When you're ready, [contact\
    \ our Partnership team here](fallback::#) and we will help you set everything\
    \ up together.\r\n\r\n#### Develop\r\n\r\nRise offers a versatile development\
    \ platform with a comprehensive suite of tools and technologies.\r\n\r\nUse one\
    \ of our development frameworks to build out your app’s functionality by creating\
    \ extensions and integrating with Rise’s business solutions.\r\n\r\n#### Launch\r\
    \n\r\nRise offers several ways to distribute your app.\r\n\r\nIf you're distributing\
    \ your app **publicly**, you should:\r\n- Set up your App Market listing.\r\n\
    - Create promotional assets to showcase your app.\r\n- Submit your app for review\
    \ so the Rise team can ensure everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nIf you're **distributing\
    \ your app privately**, you can:\r\n- Install it directly on your own Rise accounts.\r\
    \n\r\n#### Grow\r\n\r\nOnce your app goes live, enhance your success by:\r\n-\
    \ Responding to user reviews.\r\n- Analyzing performance\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n#\
    \ App Installation Flow\r\n\r\nRise applications installation flow follows the\
    \ industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol, which provides a secure way for Rise users\
    \ to grant your app permissions.\r\nWhenever a user installs your app, your app’\
    s code must complete an OAuth handshake.\r\n\r\nBefore you start, it's important\
    \ to understand how the installation authentication flow works. The diagram below\
    \ shows the complete flow including all actions that your app, Rise, and the user\
    \ must take.\r\n\r\n![Installation Flow Diagram](https://wixmp-833713b177cebf373f611808.wixmp.com/images/5296fafa62ad85b05287eec1d540f49f.png)\r\
    \n\r\n## Step 1 | Set up OAuth settings for your app\r\nTo start, complete the\
    \ OAuth settings for your app with our Partnership Manager.\r\n\r\n1. Create a\
    \ dedicated a **App URL**. Rise redirects your new users to this URL when they\
    \ install your app.\r\n2. Create a dedicated a **Redirect URL**. When a new user\
    \ agrees to give your app the requested permissions, Rise redirects them to this\
    \ URL. The redirect includes your app’s temporary authorization code.\r\n> Important:\r\
    \n> 1. You must use an **HTTPS** URL.\r\n> 2. Confirm that the **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy\
    \ (COOP)** of both the app URL and redirect URL is set to `unsafe-none`. This\
    \ enables Rise to close the redirect window as part of the flow. If the COOP of\
    \ either URL is different, set it to `unsafe-none`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Step 2 | Handle\
    \ installation authentication in your app\r\nWhen a new user installs your app,\
    \ Rise redirects them to your **App URL**. \r\n\r\nMake sure to:\r\n1. Save the\
    \ `token` query parameter value.\r\n2. Skip sign-up or log-in at this point.\r\
    \n3. Immediately forward your user to the **authorization request** step by redirecting\
    \ the user to: `https://platform.rise.ai/installer/install` , make sure to Include\
    \ the following as query parameters:\r\n    - `token`\r\n    - `appId`\r\n   \
    \ - `redirectUrl`\r\n    - (Optional) `state` – to track customers during installation\r\
    \n\r\n4. After user approval on Rise\r\n    - Rise redirects the user to your\
    \ `redirectUrl`.\r\n    - Save the `code` and `instanceId` from the query parameters.\r\
    \n    - Validate the `state` (if provided). Abort if it doesn’t match.\r\n\r\n\
    > ⚠️ The authorization `code` is valid for **10 minutes**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Step\
    \ 3 | Make API calls\r\nOnce authentication is complete:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Create\
    \ Access Token\r\n\r\nSend a POST request to create an access token:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\
    \ncurl -X POST 'https://platform.rise.ai/oauth2/token' \\\r\n  -H 'Content-Type:\
    \ application/json' \\\r\n  -d '{\r\n    \"grant_type\": \"client_credentials\"\
    ,\r\n    \"client_id\": \"<APP_ID>\",\r\n    \"client_secret\": \"<APP_SECRET_KEY>\"\
    ,\r\n    \"instance_id\": \"<APP_INSTANCE_ID>\"\r\n  }'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2.\
    \ Store the access_token from the response.\r\nThe token is valid for **4 hours**.\r\
    \n\r\n#### 3. Make an API request\r\nYou can now use the access_token in the Authorization\
    \ header to call Rise APIs.\r\nFor example, call Query Wallets.\r\n```bash\r\n\
    curl -X POST \\\r\n   'https://platform.rise.ai/WalletService_/v1/rise/wallets/query'\
    \ \\\r\n    --data-binary '{}' \\\r\n   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\
    \r\n   -H 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n> Learn more:  \r\n\

    \n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# App Authentication\r\n\r\nRise uses the **OAuth** protocol\
    \ to easily manage third-party application integrations.\r\n\r\nThe OAuth API\
    \ allows your app to manage tokens that are used to authenticate Rise API calls.\
    \  \r\nBy default, OAuth authentication follows the **OAuth Client Credentials**\
    \ protocol.\r\n\r\n## With the OAuth API, You Can:\r\n\r\n- Create access tokens\
    \ for OAuth\r\n- Get information about a specific access token\r\n\r\n## Before\
    \ You Begin\r\n\r\nBefore starting to code, it's important to note:\r\n\r\n> If\
    \ your app uses basic OAuth to authenticate Rise API calls, you **must** create\
    \ access tokens by calling **Create Access Token**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\
    \n\r\n- **OAuth**: The authorization protocol used by Rise to allow third-party\
    \ apps to securely obtain access to Rise APIs.\r\n- **Access Token**: A string\
    \ used in the `Authorization` header to make authenticated calls to Rise APIs.\
    \ All Rise access tokens are of type `Bearer`.\r\n\r\n> Learn more about [access\
    \ token types](fallback::#).\r\n\r\n## About OAuth\r\n\r\nYour app must authenticate\
    \ Rise API calls using the OAuth protocol.  \r\nOAuth is a **secure and simple\
    \ method** that eliminates the need for redirects and token management.\r\n\r\n\
    ### Rise OAuth Follows: OAuth Client Credentials Protocol\r\n\r\nThis approach\
    \ **does not require an OAuth handshake** for each app installation.  \r\nInstead,\
    \ your app can directly request an access token by calling `Create Access Token`\
    \ with:\r\n\r\n- App ID\r\n- App Secret\r\n- The relevant App Instance ID\r\n\r\
    \n### Why Use OAuth?\r\n\r\n- Prevents corrupted installations\r\n- Simpler to\
    \ implement\r\n- No need to set up redirect servers\r\n- No need to manage refresh\
    \ token databases\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Authenticate Using OAuth\r\n\r\nThis article\
    \ explains how to authenticate API calls to Rise using OAuth.\r\n\r\n## Step 1\
    \ | Get App Credentials and Instance ID\r\n\r\nTo authenticate, you’ll need the\
    \ following:\r\n\r\n- **App ID**:  \r\n  Your app identifier on the Rise platform\
    \ (You received it as part of the app submission process).\r\n\r\n- **App Secret**:\
    \  \r\n  Also received it as part of the app submission process. **Keep this value\
    \ confidential.**\r\n\r\n- **App Instance ID**:  \r\n  A unique `instanceId` that\
    \ identifies your app on a specific Rise account.\r\n\r\n### How to Obtain `instanceId`\r\
    \n\r\nThere are several ways to retrieve the instance ID depending on your app\
    \ logic:\r\n\r\n- **During Installation Flow**  \r\n  When your app is installed,\
    \ during the OAuth handshake, Rise redirect the user to your URL and passes the\
    \ account `instanceId`.\r\n\r\n- **App Instance Installed Webhook**  \r\n  Triggered\
    \ when your app is installed on a Rise account.\r\n  > Recommended: Save the `instanceId`\
    \ at this point.\r\n\r\n- **Webhook Payloads**  \r\n  Each webhook from Rise includes\
    \ the `instanceId`.\r\n\r\n## Step 2 | Make an Authenticated API Request\r\n\r\
    \nTo authenticate with the REST API:\r\n\r\n### 1. Create Access Token\r\n\r\n\
    Send a POST request to create an access token:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -X POST\
    \ 'https://platform.rise.ai/oauth2/token' \\\r\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
    \ \\\r\n  -d '{\r\n    \"grant_type\": \"client_credentials\",\r\n    \"client_id\"\
    : \"<APP_ID>\",\r\n    \"client_secret\": \"<APP_SECRET_KEY>\",\r\n    \"instance_id\"\
    : \"<APP_INSTANCE_ID>\"\r\n  }'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Store the access_token from\
    \ the response.\r\nThe token is valid for **4 hours**.\r\n\r\n### 3. Make an API\
    \ request\r\nYou can now use the access_token in the Authorization header to call\
    \ Rise APIs.\r\nFor example, call Query Wallets.\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -X POST \\\
    \r\n   'https://platform.rise.ai/WalletService_/v1/rise/wallets/query' \\\r\n\
    \    --data-binary '{}' \\\r\n   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n  \
    \ -H 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>'\r\n```"

- description: "# About App Instances\r\n\r\nWhen your app is installed across multiple\
    \ Rise accounts, you need a way to identify which account is making a request.\
    \ This is where **app instances** come in.\r\n\r\nAn **app instance** represents\
    \ a unique installation of your app on a specific Rise account.\r\nEach instance\

- description: "# Rise Platform Extensions Overview\n\nRise Platform Extensions enable\
    \ app developers to seamlessly integrate their services into the Rise ecosystem,\
    \ providing merchants with powerful tools to automate operations, enhance the\
    \ dashboard experience, and streamline business processes.\n\nWith Platform Extensions,\
    \ developers can:\n\n* **Automate business logic using customizable Workflows\
    \ Extensions:** including triggers, actions, conditions, and delays.  \n* **Extend\
    \ the Rise Dashboard through Dashboard Extensions (in Beta)**:  offering tailored\
    \ back-office interfaces and configuration tools directly within the merchant’\
    s workspace.\n\nWhether you're issuing store credit after a return, sending follow-up\
    \ incentives based on order value, or adding a settings page for merchants to\
    \ manage your app—Rise Platform Extensions give you the building blocks to design\
    \ deeply integrated, merchant-friendly solutions.\n\n# What's Covered in This\
    \ Guide\n\nThis documentation covers:\n\n* **Rise Workflows**:    \n  How to create\
    \ and extend business automations with custom triggers, actions, delays, conditions,\
    \ and pre-installed workflows.  \n    \n* **Workflow Architecture and Data Flow:**\
    \    \n  Understand how triggers, actions, and schemas work together behind the\
    \ scenes.\n\nBy leveraging these extensions, your app becomes a first-class citizen\
    \ in the Rise environment—helping merchants do more, with less manual effort,\
    \ and creating better experiences for their customers.\n\n# About Rise Workflows\n\
    \n**Rise Workflows** is a powerful tool that allows Rise merchants and partners\
    \ to automate business processes.    \nAs an app developer, you can provide users\
    \ with both **workflows** and the **building blocks** they need to create them.\n\
    \n## Why Are Workflows Necessary?\n\nAs business operations grow, it's difficult\
    \ for users to manage every task manually.    \nRise Workflows remove the burden\
    \ of handling these processes from business owners, by automating them.  \nThis\
    \ leaves merchants free to focus on growing their business, instead of dealing\
    \ with the details of various business operations.\n\n**Example: Automatically\
    \ Issue Store Credit After a Return is Approved**\n\nLet’s say your app handles\
    \ product returns for merchants. Using **Rise Workflows**, you can help the merchant\
    \ automate what happens next - such as issuing store credit once a return is approved.\n\
    \n**Trigger**  \n- **Return Approved** – Your app sends a webhook or event when\
    \ a return is approved.\n\n**Actions**  \n- **Issue Store Credit** – Use Rise’\
    s \\`IssueStoreCredit\\` action to grant store credit to the customer automatically.\
    \  \n- **Send Confirmation Email** – Optionally trigger an email to notify the\
    \ customer that their store credit is available.\n\n**Workflow Logic**  \nWhen:\
    \ Return is approved by the merchant    \n→ Then: Issue store credit to the customer\
    \    \n→ Then: Send confirmation email\n\n**Why It’s Valuable**  \nThis workflow\
    \ reduces manual effort for the merchant and ensures customers receive store credit\
    \ faster, \nimproving the post-purchase experience and increasing the chances\
    \ of repeat purchases.\n\n**Rise Workflows automate these operations**, freeing\
    \ merchants to focus on growing their business.\n\n## How Do Workflows Work?\n\
    \nEvery workflow has:\n\n* **A trigger**: An event reported to Rise by an app.\
    \  \n* **At least one action**: A business operation that follows the trigger.\n\
    \n**Trigger Examples**\n\n* A customer completes a purchase on Shopify.  \n* A\
    \ customer returns an item.  \n* A visitor registers as a member.  \n* A customer\
    \ refers a product to a friend.  \n* A customer visits a physical store.\n\n**Action\
    \ Examples**\n\n* Issue store credit to a customer’s wallet.  \n* Send a ‘Store\
    \ Credit Issued’ email.  \n* Send gift card info to a third-party CRM.\n\n**Delays\
    \ and Conditions**\n\n* **Delays** pause workflows before the next step.  \n*\
    \ **Conditions** add logic to control workflow flow.\n\nThese enable users to\
    \ build **complex automations** beyond simple trigger-action chains.\n\n## Who\
    \ Can Use Rise Workflows?\n\n* **Rise Users** \\- Can build automations using\
    \ the Workflows Builder.  \n* **Rise App Developers** \\- Can use workflow extensions\
    \ to: Create triggers, actions and Provide pre-installed workflows\n\n## The Workflows\
    \ Builder\n\nRise offers users an advanced Workflow builder tool, which they can\
    \ use in any way that fits their business needs.\n\n* Every Rise account includes\
    \ out-of-the-box default triggers and actions.  \n* When a user installs a third-party\
    \ app, it can add new triggers and actions.  \n* Users create workflows with these\
    \ building blocks in the **Workflows Builder**, located in the account dashboard.\n\
    \n![Workflow builder](https://wixmp-833713b177cebf373f611808.wixmp.com/images/4e990b33a1d64bac6ae925acc838ffaa.png)\n\
    \n**Pre-Installed Workflows**  \nRise offers users pre-defined workflow templates\
    \ they can activate immediately.\n\n* Your app can also offer ‘pre build’ workflows\
    \ that are added automatically when users install your app.  \n* Users can’t change\
    \ the trigger or actions, but:  \n  *   Can configure some action settings  \n\
    \  *   May activate or deactivate the workflow\n\n# Workflows Extensions for Developers\n\
    \nAs a developer, you can extend your app with:\n\n1. **Triggers** - Expose your\
    \ events as triggers.  \n2. **Actions** - Expose your APIs as actions.  \n3. **Pre-Installed\
    \ Workflows** - Preconfigure workflows using your triggers/actions, delays, and\
    \ conditions.\n\nUsers who install your app will get access to:\n\n* The full\
    \ workflows you define  \n* The ability to enable/disable them  \n* The option\
    \ to configure action settings  \n* Limited ability to edit delays and conditions\n\
    \n## Workflows Architecture and Data Flow\n\nAs mentioned, Workflows in Rise are\
    \ built using two basic components: triggers and actions\n\n**Triggers**\n\nA\
    \ **trigger** is an event exposed and reported to Rise by an app. For examples:\n\
    \n* A visitor lands on a specific page.  \n* A return process is completed.\n\n\
    Triggers include a **payload schema**, defined by the app developer.    \nThis\
    \ schema outlines the data that is passed to Rise when the event occurs.\n\n**Actions**\n\
    \nAn **action** is a single business operation executed in response to a trigger.\
    \ For examples:\n\n* Sending a chat message.  \n* Updating a customer record in\
    \ a database.\n\nActions require an **input schema**, also defined by the developer.\
    \    \nThis schema dictates the data required to execute the action.\n\n> Actions\
    \ may use only a portion of the trigger payload.\n\n**Basic Workflow Flow**\n\n\
    1. App reports an event (trigger).  \n2. Rise receives the event payload.  \n\
    3. Rise executes an action using the trigger data as input.\n\n**Example**:\n\n\
    * Trigger provides `form name`, `submitter name`, and `submitter email`.  \n*\
    \ Action only uses `submitter email` to send a message.\n\n**Automations with\
    \ Multiple Actions**\n\nWorkflows can include **multiple actions in series**.\n\
    \n* Each action uses the original trigger payload as input.  \n* Actions can also\
    \ have **output schemas**.  \n* Output from one action is added to the payload\
    \ and passed to the next.\n\nThis allows data to **accumulate** through the workflow.\n\
    \n**Example**:\n\n* Action A outputs a `gift card code`.  \n* Action B uses that\
    \ code as part of its logic.\n\n**Workflows with Delays**\n\nA **delay** pauses\
    \ the workflow before the next step.  \nBy default, a workflow executes immediately\
    \ when it’s triggered.  \nHowever, users can configure a workflow to wait before\
    \ the next step by adding a delay.  \nA delay is a period of time that is intentionally\
    \ inserted between two steps in the automation flow.\n\n**Example: Issue Store\
    \ Credit in Stages After an Order Is Completed**\n\nA merchant wants to reward\
    \ customers gradually after they complete a purchase—offering store credit in\
    \ stages to encourage them to return and shop again.\n\nThey set up a workflow\
    \ with the trigger **\"Order completed\"**, and add multiple delayed steps to\
    \ issue store credit over time.\n\n**Workflow Logic**\n\nWhen: Order is completed\
    \    \n→ Then: Immediately issue $5 store credit    \n→ Wait: 7 days → Then: Issue\
    \ additional $5 store credit    \n→ Wait: 14 more days → Then: Issue another $5\
    \ store credit    \n→ Wait: 30 more days → Then: Issue final $10 store credit\n\
    \n**Why It’s Valuable**\n\nThis staggered reward approach keeps customers engaged\
    \ long after their initial purchase, encouraging repeat visits and increasing\
    \ long-term retention—all while fully automated through Rise Workflows.\n\nDelays\
    \ do not change the data flow—only **when** data is passed to the action.\n\n\
    > To make sure the action runs with the latest data, you can implement the `Refresh\
    \ Payload` method to update the latest data.\n\n**Workflows with Conditions**\n\
    \n**Conditions** add branching logic to workflows.\n\n- The **if path** runs if\
    \ a condition is met.  \n- The **else path** runs otherwise.\n\n**Example: Issue\
    \ Different Store Credit Based on Order Value**  \nLet’s say a merchant wants\
    \ to reward customers differently depending on how much they spent.  \nThey set\
    \ up a workflow triggered by \"Order completed\", then use a condition to check\
    \ the total order value.\n\n**Workflow Logic**  \nWhen: Order is completed   \
    \ \n→ If: Order value is greater than $100 → Then: Issue $20 store credit    \
    \ \n→ Else: → Then: Issue $5 store credit\n\n**Why It’s Valuable**  \nThis lets\
    \ merchants run tiered incentives automatically encouraging higher spend while\
    \ still rewarding smaller purchases. It also keeps workflows flexible, personalized,\
    \ and data-driven.\n\nEach branch must have its own **input schema**, even if\
    \ it might not execute.  \n> Ensure that each schema matches the expected structure\
    \ of the data.\n\n**Summary**\n\n| Feature     | Description                 \
    \                                                |  \n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\
    \  \n| Trigger     | Event that starts a workflow. Provides data via payload schema.\
    \             |  \n| Action      | Operation performed. Uses input schema to define\
    \ required data.             |  \n| Delay       | Pauses workflow for a specified\
    \ time.                                       |  \n| Condition   | Adds branching\
    \ logic to determine next steps in the workflow.               |  \n| Data Flow\
    \   | Data is passed from trigger → action(s), and accumulates across the steps.\
    \ |\n\n## Add a Trigger to Your App\n\nAs mentioned, your app can expose events\
    \ through triggers.  \nYou can define multiple triggers for your app to expose.\n\
    \nTo make an event a trigger, you’ll need to work with your **Rise contact**,\
    \ who will configure the trigger for you during the onboarding process.\n\nAs\
    \ a developer, your role is to provide the necessary information for the trigger\
    \ setup. Once completed, your trigger becomes available to merchants using the\
    \ **Workflows Builder** in their Rise account.\n\n![Workflow Builder Custom App](https://wixmp-833713b177cebf373f611808.wixmp.com/images/3331fcf420b04ba6a237bb432b717412.png)\n\
    \n**Before You Begin**\n\n* Make sure you understand how Rise triggers work. \
    \ \n* Prepare to share all required trigger details with your Rise contact as\
    \ part of the onboarding flow.\n\n**What You Need to Provide**\n\nYour **Rise\
    \ contact** will ask for the following details to set up your trigger:\n\n**1.\
    \ Trigger Name**\n\nThis is the user-facing name merchants will see when selecting\
    \ a trigger in the Workflows Builder.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n* Use passive\
    \ voice (e.g., “Order completed”).  \n* Keep it short, specific, and singular.\
    \  \n* Avoid ambiguity (e.g., “Restaurant reservation made” instead of “Reservation\
    \ made”).\n\n**2. Trigger Key**\n\nA unique key used by your backend to report\
    \ or cancel events (e.g., `myapp-order-completed`).\n\n**Trigger key requirements:**\n\
    \n* Start with a letter or number.  \n* Use only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens,\
    \ and underscores.  \n* Be unique within your app.\n\n**3. Sample Payload**\n\n\
    You’ll need to share a **sample JSON payload** for the event that should act as\
    \ a trigger.\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"orderId\": \"1234567890\",\n  \"customerId\"\
    : \"987654321\",\n  \"totalAmount\": 59.99,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-14T12:34:56Z\"\
    \n}\n```\n\nBased on your sample, our team will generate a JSON schema and collaborate\
    \ with you to refine it.\n\n**Schema configuration includes:**\n\n* Display names\
    \ for each field (what the merchant sees)  \n* Descriptions to clarify field usage\
    \  \n* Required fields  \n* Example values for UI previews\n\nIf needed, we’ll\
    \ walk you through any unclear fields or data relationships.\n\n**Optional Enhancements**\n\
    \nDepending on the functionality you want to offer, we may recommend the following:\n\
    \n**Filterable Fields**\n\nTo give merchants more control, you can make specific\
    \ payload fields filterable (e.g., totalAmount > 50).  \nShare which fields you\
    \ want to make filterable and which logic operators should be supported (e.g.,\
    \ equals, greater  \nthan, contains, etc.).\n\n**Testing the Trigger**\n\nOnce\
    \ we’ve configured the trigger, you’ll:\n\n* Install your app on a test Rise account.\
    \  \n* Create a test workflow using the trigger.  \n* Use your application access\
    \ token to call the Report Event API from your server.\n\nSample Report Event\
    \ call:\n\n```json\nPOST /v1/triggers/events/report\nAuthorization: Bearer <OAuth\
    \ token>\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"triggerKey\": \"myapp-order-completed\"\
    ,\n    \"payload\": {\n        \"orderId\": \"1234567890\",\n        \"customerId\"\
    : \"987654321\",\n        \"totalAmount\": 59.99,\n        \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-14T12:34:56Z\"\
    \n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf configured correctly, the workflow will execute and your\
    \ test action (e.g., send email) will run successfully.\n\n**Going Live**  \n\
    Once testing is successful:\n\n* We’ll activate the trigger for your app  \n*\
    \ It will become available to all merchants who install your app on their Rise\
    \ account\n\nIf you'd like to offer pre-installed workflows using this trigger,\
    \ let us know — we can help bundle those as well.\n\n**Need Help?**  \nYour Rise\
    \ contact is here to guide you through the process and help troubleshoot at every\
    \ step."

- description: "# API Query Language\r\n\r\nThe query language described in this article\
    \ is implemented partially or in full by Rise APIs supporting query capabilities.\r\
    \n\r\nYou may see some similarities between the Rise API Query Language and MongoQL.\
    \ This is because the style of the Rise API Query Language is heavily influenced\
    \ by MongoQL.\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n\r\nA query object consists of 5 optional parts:\r\
    \n\r\n* `filter`: Which results to return.\r\n* `sort`: In what order.\r\n* `paging`:\
    \ Return only some of the matched entities.\r\n* `fields`: Field projection. Returns\
    \ only part of each entity.\r\n* `fieldsets`: Predefined, named sets of fields\
    \ with common use.  This is a shorthand provided by individual APIs.\r\n\r\nEach\
    \ query is always a single JSON object. An empty JSON object returns all records\
    \ according to the API's default paging and sort order.\r\n\r\nThe query object\
    \ can define a key for each of the above parts:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"filter\"\
    : { ... },\r\n  \"sort\": [ ... ],\r\n  \"paging\": { ... },\r\n  \"fields\":\
    \ [ ... ],\r\n  \"fieldsets\": [ ... ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The filter section\r\
    \n\r\nThe filter section is a single json object `{}` with the following rules:\r\
    \n\r\n### Equality\r\n\r\nThe format `{ \"<field>\": <value> }` specifies an equality\
    \ condition.\r\n\r\nFor example, `{ \"status\": \"DONE\" }` matches all entities\
    \ where `status` is `\"DONE\"`.\r\n\r\n### Operators\r\n\r\nOperators use the\
    \ format `{ \"<field>\": { \"$<operator>\": <value> } }`.\r\n\r\nFor example,\
    \ `{ \"status\": { \"$in\": [\"PENDING\", \"DONE\"] } }` matches all entities\
    \ where status is `\"PENDING\"` or `\"DONE\"`.\r\n\r\nThe operators specified\
    \ below are supported.\r\n\r\n#### Comparison operators\r\n\r\n* `$eq`: Matches\
    \ values that are equal to a specified value.\r\n* `$ne`: Matches all values that\
    \ are not equal to a specified value.\r\n* `$gt`: Matches values that are greater\
    \ than a specified value.\r\n* `$gte`: Matches values that are greater than or\
    \ equal to a specified value.\r\n* `$lt`: Matches values that are less than a\
    \ specified value.\r\n* `$lte`: Matches values that are less than or equal to\
    \ a specified value.\r\n* `$in`: Matches any of the values specified in an array.\r\
    \n* `$nin`: Matches none of the values specified in an array.\r\n* `$startsWith`:\
    \ Matches strings that start with a specified value. Not case-sensitive.\r\n*\
    \ `$isEmpty`: Matches strings or arrays that are empty or not empty, depending\
    \ on whether the specified operand is `true` or `false`.\r\n\r\n#### Logical operators\r\
    \n\r\n* `$and`: Joins query clauses with a logical *AND* and returns all items\
    \ that match the conditions of both clauses.\r\n* `$or`: Joins query clauses with\
    \ a logical *OR* and returns all items that match the conditions of either clause.\r\
    \n* `$not`: Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns items that don't\
    \ match the query expression.\r\n\r\n#### Element operators\r\n\r\n* `$exists`:\
    \ Matches items where the specified field exists and has a non-null value.\r\n\
    \r\n#### Array operators\r\n\r\n* `$hasAll`: Matches arrays that contain all elements\
    \ specified in the query.\r\n* `$hasSome`: Matches arrays that contain at least\
    \ one element specified in the query.\r\n\r\n### Sample queries\r\n\r\nIn the\
    \ following example, the compound query returns all entities where the status\
    \ equals `\"A\"` and either `qty` is less than `30` or `item` starts with the\
    \ character `p`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"status\": \"A\",\r\n  \"$or\": [\r\
    \n    {\r\n      \"qty\": { \"$lt\": 30 }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"item\"\
    : { \"$startsWith\": \"p\" }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following\
    \ example queries entities where the field `tags` value is an array with exactly\
    \ two elements, `\"red\"` and `\"blank\"`, in the specified order:\r\n\r\n```json\r\
    \n{\r\n  \"tags\": [\"red\", \"blank\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following example\
    \ queries for all entities where `tags` is an array that contains the string `\"\
    red\"` as one of its elements, or that `tags` is the string `\"red\"`:\r\n\r\n\
    ```json\r\n{\r\n  \"tags\": \"red\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following query matches\
    \ entities that do not contain the `item` field, or where the `item` field has\
    \ no value:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"item\": { \"$exists\": false }\r\n}\r\n\
    ```\r\n\r\n## The sort section\r\n\r\nThe `sort` section is an array of field\
    \ names and sort order.\r\n\r\nIf `order` is not specified for a field, the field\
    \ is sorted in ascending order.\r\n\r\nSorting is applied to the first `sort`\
    \ item, then the second, and so on:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n \
    \   {\r\n      \"fieldName\": \"sortField1\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"fieldName\"\
    : \"sortField2\",\r\n      \"order\": \"DESC\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\
    \r\n## The paging section\r\n\r\nThe `paging` section describes the size of the\
    \ data set to return per response and how many records to skip.  \r\n Each API\
    \ can support offset paging, cursor paging, or both.  \r\n See your specific API\
    \ for information on supported paging options.\r\n\r\n### Offset paging\r\n\r\n\
    With offset paging, you provide a `limit` and `offset` with each request.\r\n\r\
    \nTo retrieve additional pages, submit subsequent requests with an increased `offset`\
    \ equal to the previous page's `limit` plus `offset`.\r\n\r\nFor example, this\
    \ offset request returns records 41 through 60:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"paging\"\
    : {\r\n    \"limit\": 20,\r\n    \"offset\": 40\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###\
    \ Cursor paging\r\n\r\nWith cursor paging, each request returns a `cursors` object\
    \ that contains cursor strings that point to the next page, previous page, or\
    \ both.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve either page, use the returned `next` or `prev` cursor\
    \ in the next request's `cursor` parameter.\r\n\r\nTake this response object,\
    \ for example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"pagingMetadata\": {\r\n    \"count\"\
    : 10,\r\n    \"offset\": 0,\r\n    \"cursors\": {\r\n      \"next\": \"eyJmaWx0ZXIiOnsiJGFuZCI6W3sibGFuZ3VhZ2UiOnsiJGluIjpbImVuIiwiaGUiXX19LHsic3RhdHVzIjoicHVibGlzaGVkIn1dfSwidmFsdWUiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOiIyMDIyLTA2LTAyVDA2OjQ2OjAyLjgwMloifSwib3JkZXIiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOi0xLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOi0xLCJpZCI6LTF9fQ==\"\
    \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the returned `next` cursor to\
    \ retrieve the next page of results by forming your request like this:\r\n\r\n\
    ```json\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"cursorPaging\": {\r\n      \"cursor\"\
    : \"eyJmaWx0ZXIiOnsiJGFuZCI6W3sibGFuZ3VhZ2UiOnsiJGluIjpbImVuIiwiaGUiXX19LHsic3RhdHVzIjoicHVibGlzaGVkIn1dfSwidmFsdWUiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOiIyMDIyLTA2LTAyVDA2OjQ2OjAyLjgwM1oifSwib3JkZXIiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOi0xLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOi0xLCJpZCI6LTF9fQ\"\
    \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The fields section\r\n\r\nThe `fields`\
    \ section is an array of field paths to return.\r\n\r\nIf a field path points\
    \ to an object, the entire sub-object is returned.\r\n\r\nSubsets of sub-objects\
    \ can be returned by using dot notation.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the returned\
    \ entities contain `firstName` from the `name` sub-object and the entire `address`\
    \ object:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"fields\": [\"name.firstName\", \"address\"\
    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf both `fields` and `fieldsets` sections exist, the union\
    \ of both is returned.\r\n\r\n## The fieldsets section\r\n\r\nAn API may provide\
    \ named projections to save clients from specifying individual fields in common\
    \ cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Contacts API implements a fieldset named `BASIC`\
    \ that contains only `id`, `revision`, `info.name.first`, `info.name.last`, `primaryInfo.email`,\
    \ and `primaryInfo.phone`.\r\n\r\nTo use a fieldset, specify its name in the `fieldsets`\
    \ array.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"fieldsets\": [\"BASIC\"\
    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf both `fieldsets` and `fields` sections exist, the union\
    \ of both is returned."

            Since platformized APIs only expose PATCH and not PUT we can't assume that the fields sent from the client are the actual diff.
            This means that to generate a list of changed fields (as opposed to sent fields) one needs to traverse both objects.
            We don't want to impose this on all developers and so we leave this traversal to the notification recipients which need it.

            (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`).
            They cannot start with an underscore.

            Values can be strings, numbers, integers, booleans, or arrays.
            If a value is an array, the array items must be objects,
            and nested object properties must be
            strings, numbers, integers, or booleans only.
